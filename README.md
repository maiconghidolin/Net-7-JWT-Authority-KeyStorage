# .Net 7 JWT + Authority + Key Storage

This is an extension of the [.Net 7 JWT Authorization](https://github.com/maiconghidolin/Net-7-JWT-Auth) project.

There are a few points to consider here:

Before, we only had one API with all Controllers (auth and others).
The signing key has been fixed in the code.

Now we have several APIs: one just for authentication (authority), and as many others as we want. This way we have centralized validation for issuers and signing keys. If a token was generated by another issuer or the key was not in the list of keys generated by the authority, it will be rejected.

A new subscription key is generated over a period of time (typically 90 days). These keys are stored in a common database (can also be a redis).
So even in replicated scenarios (kubernetes or docker swarm) the key will be the same until revoked.

 - .NET 7
